  <!--  This is the file that defines the actual layout and type of the commands.
        It is divided in different sections (e.g. command definition, command
        placement, ...), with each defining a specific set of properties.
        See the comment before each section for more details about how to
        use it. -->

  <!--  The VSCT compiler (the tool that translates this file into the binary
        format that VisualStudio will consume) has the ability to run a preprocessor
        on the vsct file; this preprocessor is (usually) the C++ preprocessor, so
        it is possible to define includes and macros with the same syntax used
        in C++ files. Using this ability of the compiler here, we include some files
        defining some of the constants that we will use inside the file. -->

    <!-- Inside this section we have different sub-sections: one for the menus, another
    for the menu groups, one for the buttons (the actual commands), one for the combos
    and the last one for the bitmaps used. Each element is identified by a command id that
    is a unique pair of guid and numeric identifier; the guid part of the identifier is usually
    called "command set" and is used to group different command inside a logically related
    group; your package should define its own command set in order to avoid collisions
    with command ids defined by other packages. -->

    <!-- In this section you can define new menu groups. A menu group is a container for
         other menus or buttons (commands); from a visual point of view you can see the
         group as the part of a menu contained between two lines. The parent of a group
         must be a menu. -->

      <!-- NOTE: An important thing to know about combos is that if they are placed on a toolbar that is visible, and they are not marked
                 with the CommandFlag DefaultDisabled the shell will load your package in order to determine the item to display in the
                 display area (this is because it is done via IOleCommandTarget::Exec, and there is no special case logic to realize the
                 Exec request is really a 'query' in disguise. This sample has all combos as being enabled out of the box; if the ComboBox 
                 toolbar is set as visible, your package will be force loaded next time you start Visual Studio. But in general practice you 
                 need to consider if you want your combos to be enabled (which is the default) and if so if you are fine with your package 
                 being loaded almost immediately on rendering of the UI.
      
            The following types of combo boxes are supported: 
            DropDownCombo 
              a DropDownCombo does not let the user type into the combo box; they can only pick from the list of
              items in the drop down. The string value of the element selected is given as a parameter when the 
              command is executed (which happens automatically when the user chooses an item).
              This type of combo could be used for something like the "Solution Configurations" combo on the "Standard" toolbar. 
            IndexCombo 
              An IndexCombo is the same as a DropDownCombo in that it is a "pick from the list" only combo. 
              The difference is an IndexCombo returns the selected value as an index into the list (0 based). 
              This type of combo could be used for something like the "Solution Configurations" combo on the "Standard" toolbar. 
            MRUCombo 
              An MRUCombo allows the user to type into the edit box. The history of strings entered 
              is automatically persisted by the IDE on a per-user/per-machine basis.  
              This type of combo could be used for something like the "Find" combo that was on the standard toolbar in previous
              versions. It has been moved to the overflow area of the standard toolbar on more recent versions as part of the 
              toolbar reduction effort.
            DynamicCombo 
              A DynamicCombo allows the user to type into the edit box or pick from the list. The  
              list of choices is usually fixed and is managed by the command handler for the command.
              This type of combo could be used for something like the "Zoom" combo on the "Class Designer" toolbar.
          The following flags can be applied to Combo boxes: 
            NoKeyCustomize      (rarely used) 
            NoButtonCustomize   (rarely used) 
            NoCustomize         (rarely used) 
            DefaultInvisible    (often used: Exec is used to fetch info about combos, calling Exec on an unloaded package causes that package to load. If you place a combo on a visible 
                                 toolbar without setting DefaultInvisible, you will force load your package upon IDE startup) 
            DefaultDisabled     (often used) 
            DynamicVisibility   (often used) 
            CommandWellOnly     (used for commands that may have placements on the main menu for purposes of canonnical name generation but should not be actually created on main menu visually.) 
            IconAndText         (sometimes used) 
            FilterKeys          (rarely used ** used to hook window messages on commandbar controls) 
            StretchHorizontally (only used with combos on Toolwindow toolbars. This tells the shell, when laying out the toolbar, to stretch the combo to fill all horizontal space
                                 not taken by other controls. This is only honored for the first combo on the toolbar with this flag. An example of a toolbar that uses this is the
                                 Task List Window's toolbar.) 
          The following strings can be supplied with a command: 
            Button Text (required) ** displayed as label of the command on a toolbar if IconAndText flag is specified.
            If any of the following optional strings are missing then Button Text is used for their values. 
            Menu Text (optional) ** displayed as label of the command on a menu if IconAndText flag is specified. 
            Tooltip Text (optional) ** displayed when mouse hovers on command.
            Command Well Name (optional) ** displayed as name of command in the Add Command dialog.
            Canonical Name (optional) ** English programmatic name of command used in Command Window and DTE.ExecuteCommand. This name is used in
                                         place of the ButtonText for purposes of canonical name formation. The value of this tag is appended to the 
                                         value of the CanonicalName of the root of your placement. So if your command specifies a CanonicalName of 
                                         Foo and is placed anywhere (at any nesting level) under the File menu, its runtime canonical name would be File.Foo.
                                         In localized command/menu (CTO) resources, always provide the English canonical name in this tag so macros can be language independent. 
            Localized Canonical Name (optional) ** Localized programmatic name of command used in Command Window, DTE.ExecuteCommand, and Tools.Options 
                                                   "Environment/Keyboard" page. If you provide a CanonicalName you should *always* also provide a LocalizedCanonicalName
                                                   tag, even if they are identical text (as they would be in English since the value of the CanonicalName tag should
                                                   always be in English). Otherwise, for LocalizedCanonicalName the shell will use your ButtonText, if that is different 
                                                   than your CanonicalName it means that on non-English versions of Visual Studio your programmatic access name will be 
                                                   different than it would be on the English version.-->
